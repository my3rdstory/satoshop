After you've connected your wallet to your BTCPay, you can explore various built in tools in the software. See the full list of Use Cases [here](./UseCase.md).

## Creating the Point of Sale App

BTCPay has a PoS app which you can use to receive payments from your customers directly or to receive donations. To **create the POS app**, you need to have a store created in BTCPay. View PoS instructions [here](./Apps.md#point-of-sale-app).

## Creating the Crowdfund App

Create a **crowdfunding campaign using BTCPay**. Unlike traditional crowdfunding platforms, the creator of the campaign is the owner of the platform. Funds go directly to the creator’s wallet without any fees. View Crowdfund instructions [here](./Apps.md#crowdfunding-app).

## Creating the Payment Request

Create **custom invoices which can be shared with others**, by sending a link to your payment request. Users can pay the request at any time. BTCPay automatically updates the BTC exchange rate at the time of payment. View Payment Request instructions [here](./PaymentRequests.md).

## Creating the Pay Button

**Pay buttons** are great when you have a fixed amount for a product or a donation. You can easily embed the button into HTML. When the customer or a visitor clicks on the button, BTCPay displays a checkout page and an invoice for them. View Pay Button instructions [here](./Apps.md#payment-button).
